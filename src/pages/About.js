            Born and raised in Munich, southern Germany, and now living in Bern
            Switzerland. Found my passion in coding, especially in web
            development and UX design, after finishing a coding bootcamp. Since
            then I have spent my time gaining proficiency in all intricacies of web
            development in order to improve as a developer and problem solver.
            I'm able to create clean and functional websites as well as professional
            brandings. I'm confident in my frontend, backend and design abilities
            to the point. I'm able to confidently deliver products to my clients
            knowing that they are of high quality. I enjoy helping brands establish
            their digital presence and developing pleasant user experiences.
