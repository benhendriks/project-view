              Found my passion in coding, especially in web
              development and UX design, after finishing a coding bootcamp. Since
              then I spend my time gaining proficiency in all intricacies of web
              development in order to improve as a developer and problem solver.
              I'm able to create clean and functional websites. 
              I'm confident in my frontend, backend and design abilities
              to the point.
