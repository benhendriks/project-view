            I found my passion in coding, especially in web
            development and UX design, after I graduated a coding bootcamp. Since
            then I have spent my time gaining proficiency in all intricacies of web
            development in order to improve as a developer and problem solver.
            I'm able to create clean and functional websites. 
            I'm confident in my frontend, backend and design abilities.
