                Found my passion in coding, especially in web
                development and UX design, after i graduated a coding bootcamp. Since
                then I spend my time gaining proficiency in all intricacies of web
                development in order to improve as a developer and problem solver.
                I'm able to create clean and functional websites. 
                I'm confident in my frontend, backend and design abilities
                to the point.
